# SchemaSculpt üóø

### Your AI Co-pilot for Flawless APIs

SchemaSculpt is an intelligent, locally-run assistant for crafting perfect API specifications. It goes beyond simple validation by providing smart suggestions, one-click fixes, and AI-powered editing to streamline your API design workflow.

## About The Project

Writing and maintaining OpenAPI specifications can be tedious. It's easy to make mistakes, leave unused components lying around, or forget best practices. SchemaSculpt was built to solve this problem by acting as your AI partner for API design.

It uses a powerful, locally-run LLM (via Ollama) to understand natural language commands, allowing you to edit and extend your API specs just by having a conversation. The built-in linter and quick-fix engine help you adhere to best practices and keep your specifications clean and maintainable.

## Key Features

* **üß™ Live API Lab & Testing**: Interactively build and send requests to any endpoint defined in your spec. Target either the built-in AI Mock Server or your own live server, all without leaving the editor.

* **ü§ñ AI-Powered Mock Server**: With a single click, spin up a mock server that uses an LLM to generate realistic, context-aware mock data on the fly. The server stays in sync with your latest changes via a "Refresh" button.
* **ü§ñ AI-Powered Editing**: Use natural language prompts (e.g., "add a GET endpoint for /health") to have a local LLM modify your API specification.

* **‚ö° Real-time Validation**: Instantly see parsing and OpenAPI validation errors as you type.
* **üí° Intelligent Linter**: Get smart suggestions that go beyond basic validation, including:
    * Detecting unused component schemas.
    * Flagging operations with missing `summaries` or `tags`.
    * Enforcing `PascalCase` naming conventions for schemas.
    * Finding operations with a missing `operationId`.

* **ü™Ñ One-Click Quick Fixes**: Automatically fix linter suggestions‚Äîlike removing unused components or generating a missing `operationId`‚Äîwith the click of a button.
* **üëÅÔ∏è Live Swagger UI Visualization**: Instantly see your API rendered in a beautiful, interactive documentation panel in a separate tab.

* **üîÑ JSON <> YAML Conversion**: Seamlessly write in and convert between JSON and YAML formats with a single click.
* **‚ú® Modern UI**: A clean, professional, and resizable split-pane view that feels like a modern IDE.

## Getting Started

To get the full local environment running, you'll need to start the AI model, the Python AI service, the Java backend, and the React frontend.

### Prerequisites

* Java 21 (or higher)
* Python 3.10+
* Node.js and npm
* **Ollama**: Download and install from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com)

### Local Setup

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/sharma-manish-94/schemasculpt.git](https://github.com/sharma-manish-94/schemasculpt.git)
    cd schemasculpt
    ```
2.  **Run the Local AI Model** (in a new terminal)
    * First, pull the model:
        ```sh
        ollama pull mistral
        ```
    * Ollama runs as a background service, so you just need to ensure it's active.

3.  **Run the Python AI Service** (in a new terminal)
    ```sh
    cd ai_service
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt  # (You may need to create a requirements.txt)
    uvicorn app.main:app --relo
    ```
    The AI service will start on `http://localhost:8000`.

4.  **Run the Java Backend** (in a new terminal)
    ```sh
    cd api
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```
    The backend will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

5.  **Run the React Frontend** (in a new terminal)
    ```sh
    cd ui
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
    The frontend will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

6.  **Open the App**
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. The full application should now be running.

## üöÄ Future Roadmap

The current features provide a powerful foundation. The vision is to continue making SchemaSculpt a more indispensable AI partner for developers:

* **AI-Powered Semantic Refactoring**: The next major feature. Enable the AI to suggest high-level architectural improvements, such as consolidating redundant schemas or standardizing path structures.
* **AI-Generated Test Cases**: Automatically generate a suite of "happy path" and "sad path" test cases that can be run from the API Lab.
* **Automated Documentation**: Generate high-quality `summary` and `description` fields for all parts of the spec based on context.

The kitchen is a bit of a mess right now, and the chef (that's me) is still trying to perfect the recipe. To avoid any unexpected explosions of code, I'm not accepting contributions just yet.
