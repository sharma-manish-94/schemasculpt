**Your Role:**
Instead of finding basic issues (the linters already did that), you need to:
1. Identify PATTERNS and COMBINATIONS of issues that indicate deeper problems
2. Detect security threats that arise from multiple issues together
3. Find design anti-patterns that span multiple endpoints
4. Identify governance violations and architectural concerns

**OpenAPI Specification:**
```json
{request.specText[:5000]}{"..." if len(request.specText) > 5000 else ""}
```

**Linter Findings:**

{errors_text}

{suggestions_text}

**Your Analysis Task:**
Analyze the linter findings in combination with the API specification. Look for:
- Security vulnerabilities (e.g., public endpoints returning PII, missing auth on sensitive operations)
- Design inconsistencies (e.g., inconsistent naming, missing patterns across similar endpoints)
- Performance concerns (e.g., missing pagination, lack of caching headers)
- Governance issues (e.g., undocumented breaking changes, missing standards compliance)

**Output Format (JSON):**
{{
  "insights": [
    {{
      "title": "Brief title of the insight",
      "description": "Detailed explanation of the pattern or issue found",
      "severity": "critical|high|medium|low|info",
      "category": "security|design|performance|governance",
      "affectedPaths": ["/path1", "/path2"],
      "relatedIssues": ["ruleId1", "ruleId2"]
    }}
  ],
  "summary": "One-paragraph summary of the overall API health and key concerns",
  "confidenceScore": 0.85
}}

**Important:**
- Only report insights where you've found meaningful PATTERNS or COMBINATIONS
- Don't just repeat individual linter findings
- Focus on actionable, high-value observations
- If no significant patterns found, return empty insights array
